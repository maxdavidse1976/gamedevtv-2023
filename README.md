# Parallel Paradox
A game made for the 2023 Gamedev.tv game jam. 

## Story idea
In a realm where two dimensions exist side by side, humanity and dragons have coexisted for centuries. However, a mysterious force has disrupted the balance, causing a rift between the dimensions and threatening their existence. As a chosen hero, players embark on a quest to restore harmony and save both realms from impending doom.

## Acts

### The Awakening
The game begins with the protagonist, a young but strong human, stumbling upon an ancient artifact that grants him the ability to traverse between dimensions.
The protagonist learns that a malevolent entity known as the Shadow Weaver is responsible for the dimensional rift, seeking to harness the combined power of humans and dragons for nefarious purposes. The human protagonist encounters a wise dragon elder who explains that only by working together can they hope to defeat the Shadow Weaver and restore the balance.

### Journey to Unity
Player gets to switch between the human and dragon forms, each with unique abilities and strengths. The human form is agile and adept at navigating intricate platforming challenges, while the dragon form possesses raw power and the ability to fly or destroy obstacles that the human form can't overcome.
The human protagonist learns to rely on the dragon's strength to overcome obstacles and defeat formidable enemies, while the dragon relies on the human's agility and problem-solving skills to navigate complex puzzles and reach inaccessible areas.
